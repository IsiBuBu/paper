    "prompt": "## Your Strategic Problem: Pricing for Two Markets at Once\n\nYou are one of **3** firms competing in a circular market with a circumference of **1.0** and a total of **3600** customers.Your nearest competitors are located at a distance of **1.0/3** on either side. Your core challenge is to set a single price that balances the exploitation of your \"local monopoly\" power over nearby customers against the need to capture market share from direct competitors.\n\n### Key Information & Market Dynamics:\n\n* **Monopoly Segment:** For customers closest to you, your only competition is an \"outside good.\" You can charge them a higher price, but their total cost is your price plus a travel cost. This travel cost is calculated as the **transportation cost of $1.5 per unit of distance** multiplied by how far they are from you. If this total cost exceeds their effective **reservation price of $30**, they will buy nothing from your industry. (This reservation price is derived from a brand utility of **$40** and an outside good surplus of **$10**).\n* **Competitive Segment:** At the edges of your market, your territory overlaps with your neighbors. To win these customers, you must offer a better deal (your price + their travel cost) than your rivals. Lowering your price here directly steals their market share.\n* **The Kink:** Your demand curve has a \"kink\" at the price where your market transitions from purely monopolistic to competitive. Your pricing decision revolves around this point.\n\n### Your Task:\n\nChoose your price for this period. Your objective is to maximize your total profit, calculated as `(Your Price - $8) * Quantity Sold - $100`.\n\n### Output Format:\n\nRespond with valid JSON only:\n`{\"price\": <number>}`",

You only know that your rivals' costs are drawn from a **normal** distribution with a mean of **$10** and a standard deviation of **$2.0**. Your rivals set prices based on their private costs.\n* **Winning Condition:** The firm with the strictly lowest price captures the entire market. In the event of a tie, the market is split equally.\n* **Market Demand:** The market demand if you win is `Quantity = 100 - Your_Price`.\n* **The Pricing Trade-Off:** Your decision is a balance between two competing goals:\n    * **Profit Margin:** The higher you set your price, the more profit you make *if* you win.\n    * **Probability of Winning:** The lower you set your price, the higher your probability of undercutting all your rivals and winning the market.\n\n### Your Task:\n\nChoose the single price that you believe will maximize your *expected* profit, perfectly balancing the trade-off between the size of the prize and your chance of winning it.\n\n### Output Format:\n\nRespond with valid JSON only:\n`{\"price\": <number>}`",

    "prompt": "### Key Information & Market Dynamics:\n\n* **The Reporting Dilemma**: Your report influences both your immediate payoff and your future opportunities. The cartel uses a strict, two-period enforcement mechanism to reward truthful reporting and punish deception.\n* **Incentive-Compatible Design (The \"Odd-Even\" Scheme)**: The game operates in a two-period cycle that directly links your actions to your future market share:\n    * **Odd Periods (like this one)**: This is a **strategic period**. All firms report their cost type (\"high\" or \"low\"). Market share is allocated based on these reports:\n        * **Sole Low Reporter:** Receives 100% of the market.\n        * **Multiple Low Reporters:** The market is split equally among them.\n        * **No Low Reporters:** The market is split equally among all firms.\n    * **Even Periods (the next period)**: This is an **enforcement period**. Market share is allocated based on the reports from the *previous* odd period:\n        * If you reported **\"low\"** in the odd period (taking the immediate gain), you will receive **0% market share** in this enforcement period.\n        * The market in the even period is shared among firms that reported **\"high\"** in the odd period.\n        * If all firms reported the same type (all high or all low), the market is split equally.\n* **Persistent Costs**: Your cost type is persistent, meaning it has a high chance of being the same in the next period. The probability that your cost this period will be the same in the next period is **0.7**. Your report today will strongly influence other firms' beliefs about your likely cost state in the future.\n\n### Your Task:\n\nYour true cost this period is **low**. You must decide whether to report \"high\" or \"low\". Your objective is to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) of your profits over all periods (discount factor: **$0.9**).\n\n### Current Game State:\n\n* **Period:** 1\n* **History of your past reports:** Period 1: low, Period 3: high\n* **History of other firms' past reports:** Period 1: defender_1: low, defender_2: high; Period 3: defender_1: high, defender_2: high\n\n### Output Format:\n\nRespond with valid JSON only:\n`{\"report\": \"high\" | \"low\"}`",
