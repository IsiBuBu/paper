Your nearest competitors are located at a distance of **0.3333333333333333** on either side.\n\n### The Physics of Your Market Share\nYour market share depends entirely on how your price ($P$) compares to your neighbors' price ($P_{rival}$). You face two distinct demand regimes:\n\n1.  **Monopoly Boundary:** Customers are willing to travel to you only if their total cost (Price + Transport) is less than their reservation price ($R=15$).\n    * **Formula:** Maximum reach in one direction is $x_{max} = (R - P) / 1.5$.\n    **Strategic Implication:** If you charge a very high price, you shrink to a local monopoly and lose distant customers to the \"Outside Good.\"\n\n2.  **Competitive Boundary (The Critical Formula):**\n    If your price is low enough to compete with your neighbors, your market share is NOT fixed. It is dynamic. The boundary between you and a neighbor occurs where a customer is indifferent:\n    $$P + 1.5 \\cdot x = P_{rival} + 1.5 \\cdot (0.3333333333333333 - x)$$\n    \n    Solving for $x$ (your reach on one side), your total demand $Q$ (covering both left and right sides) becomes:\n    $$Q = 1000 \\cdot \\left( 0.3333333333333333 + \\frac{P_{rival} - P}{transport_cost} \\right)$$\n\n### Your Strategic Task\nSet a single price $P$ to maximize your **Profit**:\n$$Profit = (P - 8) \\cdot Q - 100$$\n\n**Crucial Consideration:**\nYou do not know $P_{rival}$ for certain, but you must assume your rivals are rational profit-maximizers who face the exact same incentives as you. \n* If you set $P$ too high, $(P_{rival} - P)$ becomes negative, and you lose market share rapidly according to the formula above. \n* If you set $P$ too low, you gain share but sacrifice margin.\n\nFind the Nash Equilibrium price\u2014the price where neither you nor your rational competitors would want to change.\n\n### Output Format:\nYou MUST respond with valid JSON first and only.

You only know their costs are drawn independently from a **normal** distribution (Mean=**$50**, SD=**$10.0**).\n* **The Market:** If you satisfy the winning condition, `Quantity = 100 - Your_Price`.\n\n### The Game Mechanics (Crucial):\n\n1.  **Rational Rivals:** Your rivals are not pricing at cost, nor are they pricing randomly. They are rational profit-maximizers who add a strategic markup to their private costs.\n2.  **Winning Condition:** You win **only** if your price is strictly lower than the prices set by all **2** rivals.\n3.  **Endogenous Risk:** Your probability of winning is **not fixed**. It is highly sensitive to your price.\n    * If you price aggressively (low), you squeeze your margin but maximize your chance of undercutting rational rivals.\n    * If you price passively (high), you expand your margin but risk that *at least one* rival draws a favorable cost and undercuts you.\n\n### Your Task:\n\nEstimate the likely pricing behavior of your rivals and determine the single price that maximizes your **Expected Profit**.\n$$E[\\pi] = P(Win) \\times (Price - 40) \\times Quantity$$\n\nYou must derive the optimal balance between margin and market share yourself.\n\n### Output Format:\nYou MUST respond with valid JSON first and only.

        "prompt_text": "You are in a cartel with **3** firms. Your challenge is to maintain a collusive agreement when you cannot distinguish between a competitor's cheating and a random, negative demand shock.\n\n### Rules of Engagement:\n\n* **Two Market States:** The market operates in one of two states: **Collusive** or **Price War (Reversionary)**.\n* **Imperfect Monitoring:** You cannot observe rivals' outputs, only the public market price. The price is determined by: `Price = 120 - 1 * (Total Industry Quantity) + Demand Shock`. The hidden demand shock is from a **normal** distribution (mean **0**, std dev **5**).\n* **Triggering a Price War:** If the market price in a **Collusive** period drops below the trigger price of **$60**, the market enters a **Price War** state for the next **5** periods.\n* **Price War Behavior:** During a **Price War**, all firms revert to the noncooperative Cournot quantity of **25**. In this state, the expected market price drops to **$45.00**, yielding a lower per-period profit of approximately **$625.00**.\n\n### Your Task:\n\nChoose your action for this period. Your objective is to maximize your total long-term profit (NPV), calculated with a discount factor of **$0.9**. Your marginal cost is **$20**.\n\nIf the market is Collusive, you must choose between two actions:\n\n* **Cooperate:** Produce the agreed-upon collusive quantity of **17**. This maximizes long-term group profit but offers a lower immediate payoff.\n\n* **Defect:** Produce the noncooperative Cournot quantity of **25** immediately. This yields a higher immediate profit of approximately **$1025.00** today, but significantly increases the risk of triggering a Price War starting in the next period.\n\nIf the market is in a **Price War**, you are in a punishment phase and your action is fixed at the Cournot quantity.\n\n### Current Game State:\n\n* **Period:** 1\n* **Current State:** Collusive\n* **History (Period | State | Market Price):**\nPeriod 1 | Collusive | $55.00\nPeriod 2 | Collusive | $60.00\n\n### Output Format:\nYou MUST respond with valid JSON first and only.

You will receive 100% market share (or split it if others also claim).\n        * **High Cost Claim:** If you report \"high\", you yield the market to others today.\n    * **Even Periods (Balancing)**: Market share is allocated to \"pay back\" the firms that yielded in the previous period.\n        * **The Cost of Claiming:** If you reported \"low\" in the odd period, you are **barred** from the market in the even period (0% share). This ensures you only claim the market when your cost is truly low.\n        * **The Reward for Yielding:** If you reported \"high\" in the odd period, you share the market in the even period.\n\n* **Persistent Costs**: Your cost type is persistent. If your cost is **Low** today, it is likely (Probability **0.7**) to remain **Low** in the next period.\n    * *Strategic Implication:* If you report \"low\" today, you lose the market tomorrow. If your cost stays Low tomorrow, that is a painful loss. You must weigh the **Immediate Profit** of serving the market today against the **Future Loss** of being barred tomorrow.\n\n### Your Task:\n\nYour true cost this period is **low**. \nYou must decide whether to report \"high\" or \"low\". \nYour objective is to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) of your profits (discount factor: **$0.9**).\n\n* *Note:* Reporting \"low\" when your cost is Low is **Truthful**, not deceptive. It is the intended behavior of the scheme, provided the immediate profit outweighs the future restriction.\n\n### Current Game State:\n\n* **Period:** 1\n* **History of your past reports:** None\n* **History of other firms' past reports:** No previous reports.\n\n### Output Format:\nYou MUST respond with valid JSON first and only.
